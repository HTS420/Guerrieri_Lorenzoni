    "Main Findings: \n",
    "\n",
    "(i) A credit crunch leads to a fall in consumption and real interest rates due to a forced deleveraging and an increase in precautionary savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Adding nominal rigidities to the baseline model may  exacerbate the effects on output as the zero lower bound may prevent the real interest rate from falling sufficiently in order to attain the flexible price equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Adding durable goods to the baseline model does not fundamentally alter the baseline result mentioned in (i). In this extension, there is a fall in consumption in both non durables and durables for credit constrained consumers and an increase in precautionary savings through durables and bonds for net lenders.
